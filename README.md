#FLOD
###Version 20140302

# What is this?

It is a framework for creating applications based on Linked Data. Based on all the (good and bad) experiencies from LODSPeaKr, I decided to start a new version of it, improved and augmented.

# Goal

Make LOD applications easy

#Installation

Similar to LODSPeaKr, just run

```
bash < <(curl -skL http://lodspeakr.org/flod)
```

and follow the yellow brick road :-)

# Disclaimer

Currently there is a barely usable version. Although the default components are not ready yet, you can create your own right away.
