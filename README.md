# What is this?

It is a framework for creating applications based on Linked Data. Based on all the (good and bad) experiencies from LODSPeaKr, I decided to start a new version of it, improved and augmentes. For now you can call it "LODSPeaKr 2: The Smart and The Curious".

# Goal

Make LOD applications easy

# BEWARE!

Currently there is no, I repeat, NO stable/usable version. Hopefully this will change soon.
